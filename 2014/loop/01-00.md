Keynote: Programming Should Eat Itself (Nada Amin)
==================================================

0. a stranger just gave me a huge apple fritter.

* "The evaluator which determines the meaning of expressions in a prgrmng language is just another program." â€“ SICP

* Turtles, all the way down. {diagram of "world on a turtle's back, but many turtles}
  * World represents user-level, successive turtles represent meta-levels each potentially with separate semantics

* Reflective system 'Black' describes the previous thing.
  * When it encounters undefined stuff, the 'level' is changed so that a thing can be defined in the meta-scope to be used in the other scope. after definition is complete, you can then re-enter the original scope at the original point in time.
