Visualizing Data Structures
===========================

Data Structures are Accidentally Complicated!

Differentiation between Abstract and Concrete data structures

Rule of thumb:
1. Generic terms are abstract
2. Adjectives tend to imply concreteness :)
3. Eponymous? Always concrete. Like, a Patricia tree.
