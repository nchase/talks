Making Error Handling Less Error Prone
======================================

Introduction: Why does error handling go wrong?
  - Error comes from a latin verb meaning 'to stray'. Errors are cases where the execution of a program strays from its usual path.
  - Target: errors in typical programming languages and distributed systems
    - common types: language-level (divide by zero), application level (something was implemented incorrectly)
  - Goal: dependability. Do something reasonable in response to errors (don't just fall over and die)
    - some languages (obviously) have language-level safeguards against whole classes of potential errors

{holding off on notes here}

* Exceptions: see John B Goodenough's 1975 paper!

  - Exceptions are pretty good, use them. BUT, they don't solve the problem of maintaining a consistent state. When you have exceptions AND mutable state, you get abstraction leaks.
