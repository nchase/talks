EventRacer: Finding Concurrency Errors in Event-Driven Applications (Pavol Bielik)
==================================================================================

- Common concurrency errors: articles get displayed twice, wrong directory displayed in file manager, date-sorted images displayed in wrong order, incomplete form submitted, non-operational menu, non-deterministic jquery verion loading (two versions loaded in incorrect order)

- event-driven applications are designed to hide latency. there are various asynchronous APIs designed to interact with network, disk, database, timers, and UI events
  - event-driven applications have highly-asynchronous and complex control flows
  - the order (scheduling) is non-deterministic 
  - asynchrony is NOT intuitive.

- eventracer.org -  a race detector for websites
  - EventRacer has a form (enter url) that automaticaly detects races on web pages.
    - EventRacer also works on Android code.
  - {basic example of race conditions using `<img />` onload handlers}
    - "what are the atomic events? what is the defined-order of the events"
      - by knowing these things and information about the environment, we can discover potential race conditions.
      - EventRacer produces a graph of events to determine potential order(s) of events
    - {details of how EventRacer works}
    - is the system effective at finding harmful races and ignoring or reducing benign races? 
      - apparently the answer is yes.
      - they group behaviors into 'harmful', 'synchronization', and 'harmless' classes.
