Purescript, Or, what if Brendan had been SPJ?
=============================================

* Speaker is employed with an Ad Agency where they make games
  * They were making games from scratch every time :(
  * Speaker, shortly after getting hired: "What you need is a game engine!"

* You should be able to write in a functional/reactive style with Types.

* This has been solved by elm, right?
  * Elm is like if Haskell had been designed by Jonny Ive

* Her System Constraints:
  * Deliverable size must be small – at 100KB, Elm does not meet this requirement.
  * Environment cannot be unpredictable (apparently elm is, to some degree)

* ...so she ended up using TypeScript. (:-\)
  * Full stack looked like:
    - typescript
    - rxjs/baconjs
    - html canvas

* And then purescript came out
  * Purescript is implemented in Haskell.
  * Looks a lot like haskell, produces very neat JS code.
  * Purescript is actually 'pure' – meaning it's a purely functional language.
  * Let's you drop into JS to do anything you need via FFI (foreign function interface)
