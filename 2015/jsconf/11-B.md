# Organizational Design for Open [Source|Web] ([@jorydotcom](http://twitter.com/jorydotcom))


## Speaker is COO of Bocoup.

## As COO, Ask the following:

* Do we have concrete objectives and abstract goals?
* what combination of teams do we need to get the job done?
* How do these entities exchange information in order to to create value - value being milestones, goals?

And how do we handle unexpected issues?

Open Source developers operate in a complex system. The openness doesn't necessary make it any easier.




## When defining systems for _humans_: remember "MVC" - "Mission, Value, Change"



## Mission: the mission motivates the people



## Value: What are our values?

* First, can you quantify the _thing_ that is the value?
* If not, it's a qualitative value (often happens in human systems). This can be challenging to pinpoint, but worthwhile.



## Change:

* Moving toward or away from a system will create change
* Components must work together harmoniously as they change.
* It's challenging (nearly impossible for one change to not impact others.
* Can positive change technically introduce negative change politically? Absolutely. This makes things hard.



## Complex systems are rewarding, but they fail.

* Failure happens far more consistently on the human level than on the technical leve.
* Can we simplify this? Yes, let's follow some organizational design principles.



## Organization Design Unlocks:

* Adaptation to change,
* Communication of mission
* Exchange of value



## Case Study

> "In 2012, things were going well for node.js
>  We had a thriving community [...] it was clear that we were the
>  fastest-growing org in the world."
>
>  People noted some concerns about ownership [mainly, more value
>  being created politcically than technically].
>
>  Cut to 2014 when the node and io projects split...
>  And now, today, balance has been restored.

Speaker notes that these sorts of problems are not unique.
Many open source projects struggle with these same issues.
Open governance doesn't necessarily guarantee success or growth.



## How do we design to enable success?

Good org-design is a balance of philosophy and concreteness.

Here are some principles:

* If you're doing an open-source 'thing', you should discuss purpose and value,
  agree on principles, and write them down in a place where everyone
  in the organization (and perhaps more widely) can see. [Purpose]
* (editor's note: As painful as it may be), legal entities must be produced
  for the project to scale well. [Governance]
* Decide on some decision-making structure - collaborative governance
  (e.g. most standards-bodies)? Benevolent dictatorship?
  As the people change, the values may change. [Governance]
* Decide on some decision-enforcement structure. What is your plan for proactively
  or reactively dealing with change that lives outside of the expected decision-making
  structure?

Simplicity: "Don't play Chess when you can play Checkers."

* Don't set up policies that solve 100% of problems up front.
  Optimize for a system that "throws good errors" rather than one that throws bad errors
  (or swallows them completely...)

Flexibility: "Orgs should have _structure_, but not be entirely _rigid_"

* Leave room for people to change things based on new data.

Reliability: "A system is only as reliable as its weakest component."

* There should be no surprises for people in the organization.
* Reliability is a really important component of an organization.
  Just as important as innovation.

Acceptability:

* "organizations can only function properly if they're accepted by the constituents."
* In the absence of acceptability, system will be modified (good)
  or be used ineffectively (bad).
* Pay close attention to organizational resistance/pushback.
  This an example of a "human error message" and it's very important.


[Insert Conway's Law Quote Here]



## How do we organize a better Open Web community?

* Be careful - there's a lot of [new] interest and money out there.
* We need to be able to communicate the community's values and how it works to these new entities.
* "Rising Tides lift all boats."
