> "Let's Get Physical." - Olivia Newton John



## Speaker works for Telenor R&D and some Mozilla+Firefox OS

* We are on the verge of a new era.
* The scenario used to be that computing/programming was confined to a box.
* The new scenario is that computing happens everywhere.
  Robotics + IoT is growing. Code lives in the real world.



## Speaker notes that talk will be punctuated by audience participation and GIFs.

* Music + programming has taken off recently. ("algorave")
* There are lots of phones at concerts these days.
  * Let's take advantage of this today: http://192.168.157.18:9321
* Bluetooth beacons: they have a long battery life, they are cheap,
  they broadcast their presence, and [using JS] we can do interesting things
  when we find them...
  * three beacons + chip that can detect them with JS = object triangulation.
  * tons of possibilities here: object position and audience participation are a few.
* What if we could embed information in bluetooth beacons?
  Low-cost augmented reality.
