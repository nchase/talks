# The Hybrid Backbone & React App ([@peterpme](http://twitter.com/peterpme))

* UI Engineer : Trunk Club
* Github: ppiekarczyk



## Past & Present

* Brunch with Panache
  * A modular approach to building web apps with Branch
* Backbone
* Chaplin
* JQuery
* Bcrunch
* ?? Coffee Script??



## It worked great until it stopped working great



## What could UI solve on its own?

* Numerous API calls
* Lots of useless re-rendering
* Increased load time
* Huge flame chart spikes
* User complaints
* Dedicating way too much time to render debugging



## React to the Rescue!



## Replacing Backbone view with React (instant gratification)

* Reusable, encapsulated components
* Efficient diff'ing algorithm re-renders only when it needs to
* Yadda yadda yadda



## Templates & Views

(A bunch of coffee script)



## CSS Styles as Components

(More coffee script I can't read)



## No magic, just good javascript

* React makes you use the good parts of javascript again,
  that were abstracted away by other frameworks (ie `apply`, `call`)



## Migration Process

* Start with small componenets
* Use a Backbone/React Mixin
* Get familiar with the API
  * lifecycle methods (mount, unmount, props)
* Convert your parent view to use React.createElement instead



## React Backbone Adapter



## Attaching a React component to a Parent level Backbone view

(Sweet, even more unreadable coffee script with impossible contrast)

1. Create
2. Identity
3. Attach
4. Render
5. Dispose



## Signup Controller



## React Backbone Wrapper

1. Check for mount
2. Check for updates
3. Pass in the props
4. Find the node in the DOM
5. Apply an indentifier class
6. Render!



## `signup-header.cjsx`

(god damn unreadble coffee script)



## Passing Down Data

* Multiple Models & Collections as Props



## Props (yep)



## State (yep)



## Guess What?

(more coffee script!)
