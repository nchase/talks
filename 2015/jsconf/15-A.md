# Visualizing Process Evolution ([@dann](http://twitter.com/dann))

If code is directing evolution of a process, in many ways its like the evolution of a cell
(where the DNA directs the evolution of cell)



## Steps in evolution:

1. data: data structures in JS are becoming increasingly sophisticated/complicated.
   async + mutable state produces the same problems as mutable state + threads.

   the state communicates _instantly_ and bypasses the normal
   communication mechanisms.

   * HAMT - hash-array mapped trie. hashing gives good distribution properties
   * step-through debuggers give us a granular "street-level" view of
     what's happening, but how do we get the 10k foot view?

2. a simpler language: can we see full granularity along with the 10k view?

3. now that we've seen it with a simple language, what if we can do it in JS?



Note: this was amazing.
