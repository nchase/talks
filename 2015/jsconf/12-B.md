# Tungsten.js: Virtual DOM + Server Rendering in a Legacy Codebase ([@andrewrota](http://twitter.com/andrewrota))



## Performance matters

* Render server-side mustache templates with C++ extension in PHP
* Lazy load non-critical images, data and JS Modules
* Bundle JS for cache/load time optimization



## Room for improvement

* jQuery + Backbone.js = slow DOM manipulation
`render() { this.$el.html(template.render(data)); }`
  * over-rendering
* Devs (over)use direct DOM manipulation
`this.$el.addClass('addNewClass');`
* Devs have to thikn about low-level DOM performance
  * `jQuery.empty()` is > 15x faster than setting innerHTML to empty
  * petty code review comments/arguments over speed



## What do we do now?

* Could have used Ember
* Could have used Angular
* Really liked React, wanted to re-write everything in it



## Problems with Rewrites

* Rewrites are expensive
* Stall other developers
* Break a lot of things



## Characteristics of Legady Codebases

* Existing tech stack
* Old frameworks/libraries
* Technical debt
* Also, it works!

## What we liked about current stack

* Shared templates (PHP + JS)
* Fast server side rendering
* Existing Backbone.js components



## What we liked about other libraries

* Fast client-side rendering
  * Using Virtual DOM
* No DOM manipulation



## What do we do now?

* Liked the idea of being able to look at individual components and pick libraries for each

## What we did

* Used Ractive to precompile Mustache templates into object, not strings
* Used the Virtual DOM library from Mercury
* Used Backbone to bind events and handle data layer
* Wrote an integration library to put it all together ( [Tungsten](http://github.com/wayfair/tungstenjs) -> open sourced)



## Using existing infrastructure

* Back when we were laying phone line, but it was still expensive, they realized they could leverage barb wire fences as a way to transmit telephone signals or lay new phone lines
  * Farmers actually did this to create phone communcations
  * It's not perfect, but it's far less expensive when an ideal solution may be feasable for a long time



## Demo using DBMonster (DBMonster Implementation Comparisons)

* Angular & Ember were slow
* React was much faster than all the other demos, by a lot (surpise surprise)
* Tungsten was pretty much as fast a React (applause)
* "Paperclip" is even faster (I don't know what that is though)
