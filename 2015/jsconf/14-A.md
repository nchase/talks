## How do we find agency in communities? How do we _maintain_ communities?

* In Rockford, IL, there are about 150 developers. About half are "web developers".
  This is a very small developer community, relatively speaking.
* Communities are important. Service to others is important. Being service-oriented is really important.
  * Even little things, like holding doors for people, are enormous.
* Your family might be your first community.
* The people that you work with (in your dayjob) are a community.



## Organizing Communities is challenging, sometimes an uphill battle. What's a Meetup?

* It can be a lot of things. One of those things is an outlet for airing professional grievances.
* It's a place to learn and share knowledge.



## What makes a good meetup?

* A good meetup is about the users. The code is ephemeral. It's about the people in the community, not the code.
* So happy people = a good meetup.



## Ideals

* Speaker read a lot of sci-fi as a kid. Then he grew up.
  Maybe these sci-fi-based expectations weren't realistic.
* Utopian ideals are not realistic, but that doesn't mean that you can't
  bring them to reality and try to inject some of those ideals
  into the real world.
* The Cathedral & The Bazaar - Eric Raymond
  * If you haven't read this book, you really should.
  * Relevant to communication models in _all_ communities, not just software.



## So really, what are Meetups?

* In addition to the above definitions, they're a chance for us to become
  a better version of ourselves.
* Very similar to open source, but in 'meat space'
* What do you do every day? Don't be too isolated.
  Personal experience and human engagement trumps all.
* Speaker's small tech community struggled to have meetups.



## How do we _run_ a Meetup?

* Share the load (if possible). Additional organizers give shared perspective
  and reduce possibility of unexpected outages.
* You must have a code of conduct. If people feel unsafe, they will not come.
  * There _must_ be consequences for harassment.
* You must have a physical space. Food also helps.
  * If nothing else, try local colleges and universities.
  * If the group is small enough, try a coffee shop or pub to start.
* You must have an internet connection. Don't overlook this!
* Shared calendars, shared documents.
* Social media - need _some_ mechanism to publicize/hype the event(s).



## How do we sustain a meetup?

* Always focus on the users. Users will grow your meetup (by talking to other users)
* Try something different - you may want to try different topics or different formats.
  * Speaker was able to increase engagement by having everyone collaborate on a project.
* Consider inviting your coworkers. But if they can't come, don't harass them.
* What you consider mundane might be amazing to others. Don't be afraid to share!
* Try going to _regional_ meetups. They're a great way to learn and meet people
  who can cross-pollenate meetups.



## Be Excellent To Each Other.
